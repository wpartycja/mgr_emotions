You are using a model of type hubert to instantiate a model of type wav2vec2. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.
Some weights of Wav2Vec2Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ntu-spml/distilhubert and are newly initialized: ['feature_projection.layer_norm.bias', 'feature_projection.layer_norm.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
